0.06  2004-08-06  (from Taiwan to you)

- Arguments given new() besides apache_req and args are now passed
through to the _init() method.


0.05  2004-05-29

- The handler method was broken.

- Added a warning about being careful to make sure that the app object
goes out of scope at the end of the request, because if you make it a
global via the Mason Interp object's set_global() method, it can
persist across requests.

- Calling clean_request_args() on the ApacheHandler object at the end
of the request is no longer needed.  Thanks to Ken Williams for
suggesting that I use $r->pnotes().  But why didn't I think of that?


0.03  2004-05-12

- _LoadActions was broken, and didn't work at all.


0.02  2004-05-12

- Fix a dumb syntax error that broke the session_wrapper() method.
